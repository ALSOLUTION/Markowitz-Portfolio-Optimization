# Markowitz-Portfolio-optimization
This code takes in the top shares in India's current Index stock and performs the Markowitz analysis on it to predict what percentage of each share should make up the portfolio. 


My personal Interest in finance has led me into makking this project and i hope some finance enthusiast like me will find it useful.

Some articles you will find useful.

<H1> Modern Portfolio Theory</H1>
Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) is an investment theory developed by Harry Markowitz and published under the title "Portfolio Selection" in the Journal of Finance in 1952.

There are a few underlying concepts that can help anyone to understand MPT. If you are familiar with finance, you might know what the acronym "TANSTAAFL" stands for. It is a famous acronym for "There Ain't No Such Thing As A Free Lunch". This concept is also closely related to 'risk-return trade-off'.

Higher risk is associated with greater probability of higher return and lower risk with a greater probability of smaller return. MPT assumes that investors are risk-averse, meaning that given two portfolios that offer the same expected return, investors will prefer the less risky one. Thus, an investor will take on increased risk only if compensated by higher expected returns.


I have explained further in the code as we proceed further.
